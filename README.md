# South Park Movian Plugin

This plugin makes it possible to view every South Park episode in Movian.

This plugin uses the same API that is used by the official Android app, so if you're interested how it works feel free to take a look ;)


The following audio languages are offered (depending on episode), descriptions are available in many other languages:
 - German
 - English
 - Polish
 - French


## Installation
This plugin is available via the official plugin source, so just start Movian and go to the "available plugins" menu.
However, if you want to install the plugin manually just "play" the zip file with Movian and it will be installed.

If you are developing its easier to use the -p command line argument of Movian followed by the path of the folder containing the plugin data.
